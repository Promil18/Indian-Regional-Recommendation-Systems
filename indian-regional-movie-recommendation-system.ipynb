    "# Indian Regional Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for a recommendation system is to extract information from data about the relationship existing between users and products. One of the common usage is to take the products that the user already likes and and answer the question \"What other products can be recommended to the user?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways of answering the above question. These are the three main types algorithms being used for recommendation systems, to try answering different aspects of recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content Based Filtering**\n",
    "  - Used to find products with \"similar\" attributes. Example: if a person likes movies from action genere then recommend other books from action genere.\n",
    "  - The movie will have different attributes, such as, direction, cast, cinematography, story etc. A field specialist will rate all these attributes on a fixed scale.\n",
    "  - Based on similarity between these attributes, we can recommend movies to a new user once they have picked up a few movies that they liked.\n",
    "  - One major drawback of this method is getting a field expert to rate movies on their attributes. It is time conuming and inefficient.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Collaberative Filtering**\n",
    "  - This is somewhat indirect way of recommending, but is the most used method in the industry. Here we find products liked by \"similar\" users (they have the same interest as the active user) and recommend them to the active user. \n",
    "  - For an active user, who has rated some movies highly in the system; we find other users who have rated these movies in a similar manner (they might have rated other movies as well). These users have commen interests, so we can use other user's ratings as a guide for the likeliness of movie recommendation to the active user.\n",
    "  - Here the assumption is that the movies that \"similar\" users like are similar to each other. In this method also we are measuring similarity of products, however here the similarity is measured indirectly through similarity of users.\n",
    "- **Association Rules Learning**\n",
    "  - Here we recommend \"complimentary\" products, for example, if someone is buying a smartphone then recommend a back cover or a tempered glass etc.\n",
    "  - In movie recommendation, the products are substitutable to each other. However, in the above example of smartphone, the products are complimentary.\n",
    "  - This algorithm tries to answer the question, \"If a person likes to buy smartphones, along with it, what else would they like to buy?\" i.e \"Which products are *associated* with each other?\""
